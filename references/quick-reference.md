5. **Issue Quality** - Well-defined problem
6. **Activity** - Active maintenance
7. **Contribution Feasibility** - Realistic to complete
8. **Evidence Quality** - Strong supporting evidence

## GitHub CLI Commands

```bash
# List open issues
gh issue list --state open

# Filter by label
gh issue list --label "bug" --state open

# View specific issue
gh issue view 1234

# Check for linked PRs
gh issue view 1234 --json timelineItems

# List PRs
gh pr list --state open

# View PR details
gh pr view 5678
```

## Git Commands

```bash
# Recent activity
git log --oneline -20

# Search code
rg "pattern" src/

# Find files
find . -name "*.ts" -type f

# Check blame
